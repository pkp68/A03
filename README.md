To begin, GITHUB is a platform where code is hosted and is open source for exploration and use. GIT is the actual system for tracking changes in the code during development. This platform and system is for coordinating work among programmers and track changes in the projects. 

Inside of GITHUB, there is a directory or storage space where projects are kept known as repositories. Code files, text files, image files, and image files can be kept inside of these repositorites. 

Version control is easy in git because the history of the code is saved; this ensures you never have to rewrite code. Committing allows you to make a checkpoint in the repository at that time so there is a point to refer to when change or reversal is needed.
