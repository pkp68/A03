To begin, GITHUB is a platform where code is hosted and is open source for exploration and use. GIT is the actual system for tracking changes in the code during development. This platform and system is for coordinating work among programmers and track changes in the projects. It is a means to source code management. 

Inside of GITHUB, there is a directory or storage space where projects are kept known as repositories. Code files, text files, image files, and image files can be kept inside of these repositorites. 

Version control is easy in git because the history of the code is saved; this ensures you never have to rewrite code. Committing allows you to make a checkpoint in the repository at that time so there is a point to refer to when change or reversal is needed. A revision is known as a commit. 

Since the main reason most people use GIT is for the ease of access of other's work and your work, it makes sense for multiple people to work on a code at the same time. A branch is a different version of the same main code literally like a tree. The trunk is the main code and the branches are the different versions. Later, the branches can be merged back into the original code. GIT can clone a repository which is useful for creating remote-tracking branches apart from the main ones. It's a way of making a project based off the original project. 

Sometimes there can be merge conflicts if theres competing code and this needs to be resolved before the merge can actually be completed. 

If working on a local computer, the push command is needed to make the code visible online on GITHUB. And the opposite, if you want the most updated version of the repository, use the pull command to take the newest code to use.
