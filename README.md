To begin, GITHUB is a platform where code is hosted and is open source for exploration and use. GIT is the actual system for tracking changes in the code during development. This platform and system is for coordinating work among programmers and track changes in the projects. It is a means to source code management. 

Inside of GITHUB, there is a directory or storage space where projects are kept known as repositories. Code files, text files, image files, and image files can be kept inside of these repositorites. 

Version control is easy in git because the history of the code is saved; this ensures you never have to rewrite code. Committing allows you to make a checkpoint in the repository at that time so there is a point to refer to when change or reversal is needed. A revision is known as a commit. 

Since the main reason most people use GIT is for the ease of access of other's work and your work, it makes sense for multiple people to work on a code at the same time. A branch is a different version of the same main code literally like a tree. The trunk is the main code and the branches are the different versions. Later, the branches can be merged back into the original code. GIT can clone a repository which is useful for creating remote-tracking branches apart from the main ones. It's a way of making a project based off the original project. 

Sometimes there can be merge conflicts if theres competing code and this needs to be resolved before the merge can actually be completed. 

If working on a local computer, the push command is needed to make the code visible online on GITHUB and literally push the changes. And the opposite, if you want the most updated version of the repository, use the pull command to take the newest code to use. The fetch command downloads commits and files from a remote repository into your local repository. Fetching is used when you want to see what the team is working on. A remote is a common repository that everyonce can use to exchange their changes - this doesn't create a tree.  

Now that the basic terms are defined, we can use them to navigate GIT and GITHUB. 

1. Sign up on GITHUB and install GIT
2. Make a new repository
3. Learn how to use the terminal, here are some commands that could be used
  - git init : initialize  project with all of the files in your project directory, run
  - git add <###> : add files to working area
  - git add . : add all of your files to the working area. 
  - git commit -m "<add a commit message here>" : use to commit changes
  - git push : to push changes 
  - git pull : pull changes 
  - git status : see if there are changes to push 
  - git clone : retrieve the clone
  - git merge : merge into main code
  - git checkout master : go straight to master branch
  - git diff : see what has changed
  - git help : help with running commands 
4. Pull request to start a branch off another's code or your own
5. Clone/download others code to use it
